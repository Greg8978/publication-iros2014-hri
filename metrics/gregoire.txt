Hello everyone!
Sorry I'm not communicating much, thank you for taking care of everything :)
Thank you Ingo for the piece of advice on the tool to use.

So here is my output for MaRDi scenario:

SLOC    Directory    SLOC-by-Language (Sorted)
238     MaRDi           python=238


Totals grouped by language (dominant language first):
python:         238 (100.00%)


Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 238
Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 0.04 (0.53)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Person-Months = 2.4 * (KSLOC**1.05))
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 0.16 (1.97)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Months = 2.5 * (person-months**0.38))
Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 0.27
Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 5,985
 (average salary = $56,286/year, overhead = 2.40).


1b) What is the ratio in your implementation between Morse-specific code
(e.g., modules where "import morse" occurs) and other, more generic code?


  238 (morse services, objects settings)
+25   (json)
--------
263



1c) Which other libraries, besides Morse, do you use in your scenario?
I'm using json, libmove3d, SPARK

1d) While developing the scenario, was it necessary at some point to
modify the core Morse code?

I modified a grasping service for human and pr2 to allow to pick a designated object.


2a) For how long, roughly, have you been working on implementing the
scenario?

That's difficult to answer. I guess about one 1 week.


2b) How many people have *developed* the scenario?

2


2c) How many people are *using* the scenario?
Currently 2 but it will be usefull for all our project's team (about 10 persons).

    sloccount reports LOC by type of file, so it can differentatiate XML (as
    used in roslaunch files) and shell-scripts from other source-code.

    However, it doesn't (by default) know that ".launch"-files are XML. You
    can add a symbolic link with an ".xml"-extension, though, and it will
    pick that up, if you think the amount of XML in the launch files is of
    relevance.

    cheers, Ingo
