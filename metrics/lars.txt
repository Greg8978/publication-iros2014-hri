I only considered the part for the data generation using MORSE, but
not the code for generating/learning models based on the generated
data.
Also not included in the sloccount are 118 lines of code that I added
to morse's supervision services (git blame supervision_services.py |
grep Lars | wc) )

Here is the result of sloccount:

Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 667
Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 0.13 (1.57)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Person-Months = 2.4 * (KSLOC**1.05))
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 0.25 (2.97)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Months = 2.5 * (person-months**0.38))
Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 0.53
Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 17,659
 (average salary = $56,286/year, overhead = 2.40)

 118 (morse services)
+18   (morse.rpc calls in the other code)
--------
136

136 / (118 + 667) = 0.1732  (or 17.32 %)

I added some services allowing for remote procedure calls to beam
objects around and get information from them. But no changes in the
core.

That's difficult to answer. I guess about one 1 week.

1 (me)

currently 4 (but soon more)

I hope that helps. Let me know if something is not clear.

cheers,
